## Build instructions
{: menu="Build" }

> First step would be to clone the git repository at 'https://github.com/ddc-java-17/teamle-Tarlet1'. You would then clone this project into the IDE of your choice as a gradle project. Finally, run the app build task.


## User instructions
{: menu="User" }

> Once the user has launched the app, they should first hit the three dots int the right corner of the screen and go into the settings screen. There they should pick the sport and the league they want to guess list to be from, then return to the home screen. They should then hit the new game button on the top of the screen. After that the Auto complete text view will be available, and they can start typing out team names and select them to submit their picks. After a completed game, they can use the floating action button on the bottom right of the screen to go see their scores.
