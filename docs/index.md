## Summary

The app I intend to build will be a guessing game, where the goal is to guess a professional sports organization. After each guess you send in, you will be given back a response showing you how close your guesses were for each category on the board. The categories that will be shown are location, division, conference, overall sport (if playing with multiple sports as options), and number of championships won. I'm still brainstorming on additional categories based on how many leagues you have selected. 

The functionality of the app would include picking a league or multiple leagues for the pool to include. The game would consist of a drop-down list of all teams in the selected leagues, and would narrow itself down to match the characters typed by the user. There would be a result screen showing you how many guesses you took or what the correct answer is if you run out of guesses. The game will also track stats that you could check from the profile screen. It will also include a messaging feature, where you can challenge friends of family to beat your score. 

## Intended users & user stories
{: menu="Users" }
* fans of the NFL

    > As a fan of the NFL, i want to use the NFL teams only option to test my knowledge of NFL franchises and see if i can figure out which team is the correct answer.

* People who enjoy puzzles

    > As a person who likes to push myself mentally, I want to use this app to push my sports knowledge to the limit and see the fewest amount of guesses i'd need to solve a game.
  
* Overall sports fans 

    > As a sports fan in general, i want to use the all leagues option to truly put my sports knowledge to the test, and see if i can narrow it down to the right leagues and ultimately, right team as quickly as possible.



## Functionality

The user will be able to select from which leagues they would like the list of teams to be from.
They will then submit there first guess.
the result given back will have all categories for the team they sent as the guess.
If the team they guessed and the team that is the correct answer are the same in one of those categories, the answer for the team they sent in that category will be green. If its close, but not quite right, it will be yellow. If its not close or right, it will be white.
Given those clues the user will submit another guess, and the same result will occur for the new team they submitted.
This continues until the user gets the team right, or until they ruin out of guesses, then the correct team will be shown to them 
The user will be given the option to play again, or to return home to select a new league/leagues.
